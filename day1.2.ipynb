      "----------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "A function signature tells you how the function will be called. It starts with the keyword def, which tells Python that you are defining a function. Then comes a space, the name of your function, an open parenthesis, the comma-separated input parameters for your function, a close parenthesis, and a colon. Here's what a function signature looks like for a function that takes no arguments:\n",
      "\n",
      "    def myFunction():\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's what a function signature looks like for a function that takes one argument called string:\n",
      "\n",
      "    def myFunction(string):\n",
      "\n",
      "And one for a function that takes two arguments:\n",
      "\n",
      "    def myFunction(myList, myInteger):\n",
      "\n",
      "Parameters should have names that usefully describe what they are used for in the function.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've used the words parameters and arguments seemingly interchangeably to reference the input to functions. The distinction isn't really important right now, but if you're curious: in function signatures the input is called parameters, and when you are calling the function the input is called arguments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 2: do useful work inside the function\n",
      "------------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "Underneath the function signature you do your useful work. Everything inside the function is indented, just like with if/else blocks, so Python knows that it is a part of the function.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can use the variables passed into the function as parameters, just like you can use variables once you define them outside of functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "    def add(x, y):\n",
      "        result = x + y\n",
      "\n",

      "------------------------\n",

      "\n",
      "if number is less than 0, you return number * -1 and never even get to the last line of the function. However, if number is greater than or equal to 0, the if expression evaluates to False, so we skip the code in the if block and return number.\n",
      "\n",
      "We could have written the above function like this if we wanted. It's the same logic, just more typing:\n",
      "\n",
      "    def absoluteValue(number):\n",
      "        if number < 0:\n",
