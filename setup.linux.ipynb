Some companies wrap it up together with useful related programs.  We'll use one such packaging called [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/), published free of charge by [Continuum Analytics](https://store.continuum.io), because that's the most reliable way to get everything we need installed. \n",
